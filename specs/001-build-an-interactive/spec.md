# Feature Specification: Interactive NPX CLI - Meet Chan Meng

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-interactive`
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build an interactive CLI application that can be run via 'npx chan-meng' to introduce Chan Meng through an engaging, story-driven experience. The application should showcase Chan's extreme minimalist lifestyle journey, from her constrained family life to her current life in New Zealand. Users should be able to explore different aspects of her life (physical minimalism, social minimalism, philosophy) through an interactive menu system with keyboard navigation, typewriter effects, and ASCII art. The experience should be memorable, authentic, and respect user's time with options for quick overview or deep dive exploration."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Input provided: NPX CLI for personal introduction
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Terminal users interested in meeting Chan
   ‚Üí Actions: Navigate menus, read stories, explore philosophy
   ‚Üí Data: Chan's life stories, minimalist practices, contact info
   ‚Üí Constraints: Respect user time, authentic content only, terminal-based
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the CLI track user progress between sessions?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should there be a "share quote" or "export" feature?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Maximum acceptable startup time target?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary scenario: User runs npx chan-meng, explores, exits inspired
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Content modules, user preferences, navigation state
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has 3 clarification points"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for /clarify phase)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02

- Q: What is the maximum acceptable startup time from running `npx chan-meng` to displaying the welcome screen? ‚Üí A: < 5 seconds
- Q: Should the CLI track and persist user progress between sessions? ‚Üí A: Yes - Remember visited modules and offer "resume where you left off"
- Q: Should text be displayed with typewriter effect, and should users be able to skip/disable it? ‚Üí A: No typewriter effect - show all text immediately for speed
- Q: Should the CLI offer two distinct experience modes (quick tour vs full experience)? ‚Üí A: Yes - Quick tour shows highlights only (~2-3 min), full shows everything
- Q: What contact/social information should be displayed in the "Connect" module? ‚Üí A: Email + GitHub + LinkedIn + any other professional links

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

**As a** terminal user curious about Chan Meng,
**I want to** run a single command (`npx chan-meng`) that introduces me to Chan through an interactive, story-driven experience,
**So that** I can understand her minimalist philosophy, life journey, and principles in an engaging way without leaving my terminal.

**Success criteria**: User completes at least one story module and reports feeling they "met" Chan in some meaningful way.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user with Node.js installed, **When** they run `npx chan-meng` for the first time, **Then** the CLI starts within 5 seconds, displays a welcoming introduction, and presents a clear main menu with navigation instructions.

2. **Given** a user at the main menu, **When** they select "The Journey" module, **Then** they see Chan's life story presented in digestible segments with the ability to continue, skip, or return to menu.

3. **Given** a user reading a story module, **When** they press the designated "exit" key, **Then** the CLI gracefully exits immediately without data loss or errors.

4. **Given** a user who previously explored some content, **When** they run `npx chan-meng` again, **Then** they see a "welcome back" message with options to either resume where they left off or start fresh.

5. **Given** a user interested in contacting Chan, **When** they navigate to the "Connect" section, **Then** they see Chan's contact information and social links clearly displayed.

6. **Given** a user who explored multiple sections, **When** they reach the end of the experience, **Then** they receive a thoughtful closing message that reflects minimalist values and invites reflection.

7. **Given** a first-time user at the welcome screen, **When** they are prompted to choose between Quick Tour and Full Experience, **Then** they can select Quick Tour to see a 2-3 minute curated highlight reel, or Full Experience to explore all content at their own pace.

8. **Given** a user in Quick Tour mode, **When** they decide they want more depth, **Then** they can exit to Full Experience mode and access the complete main menu.

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when** the terminal window is too small to display content properly?
  - CLI should detect minimum dimensions and show a friendly message if too small.

- **What happens when** the user's terminal doesn't support color or Unicode?
  - CLI should gracefully degrade to plain text with ASCII-safe characters.

- **What happens when** a user mashes keys rapidly or inputs unexpected characters?
  - CLI should remain stable, ignore invalid inputs, and re-prompt clearly.

- **What happens when** the user is offline?
  - CLI should work completely offline since it's installed locally via npx.

- **What happens when** the user has no prior NPX/Node.js experience?
  - The README and any error messages should guide them to install prerequisites.

## Requirements

### Key Entities

- **Content Module**: Represents a discrete section of content users can explore (e.g., "The Journey", "Philosophy"). Each module has:
  - Title
  - Estimated reading time
  - Content segments (can be multi-part)
  - Navigation points (back, next, menu)

- **Navigation State**: Tracks where user currently is in the experience:
  - Current module
  - Current segment within module
  - Menu history (for "back" navigation)

- **User Preferences**: Stores user session data locally (e.g., in `~/.chanmeng-cli/`):
  - Visited modules list
  - Last position within multi-segment modules
  - Display preferences (color on/off, animation speed)
  - Terminal capabilities detected (for graceful degradation)

- **Story Segment**: Individual pieces of Chan's narrative:
  - Text content
  - Associated visual elements (ASCII art, quotes)
  - Pacing information
