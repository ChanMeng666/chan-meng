If it's not useful RIGHT NOW, discard it.

This isn't a metaphor. Chan means it literally. That sweater you might wear next winter? Gone. That contact you haven't messaged in months? Deleted. That book you plan to read someday? Given away.

Most people accumulate for imagined futures. They buy insurance against uncertainty, hedge against change, prepare for scenarios that rarely materialize. Chan does the opposite: she optimizes for the present moment.

This philosophy emerged from watching her mother cling desperately to a failing marriage, to material possessions, to relationships that brought only pain. The holding on was the problem. The attachment was the suffering.

Chan's minimalism isn't about aesthetics or Instagram-worthy spaces. It's about radical acceptance of impermanence. Nothing lasts. Everything changes. Why pretend otherwise?`,

      title: 'Relationships as Objects',
      content: `The most controversial aspect of Chan's philosophy is her approach to relationships. She treats them like any other possession: useful or not, keep or discard.

When a high school friend group chat becomes noise? Exit without explanation. When a college friend's life path diverges from hers? Delete the contact. When a romantic relationship stops serving her growth? End it cleanly, without lingering.

"Let me be clear," Chan says. "I'm not sociopathic. I'm capable of deep connection. But I refuse to maintain relationships out of guilt, obligation, or nostalgia."

She has fewer than 30 WeChat contacts. No long-term friendships spanning decades. No "besties" from childhood she keeps in touch with. When people find this shocking, Chan asks: What are you really maintaining? The relationship, or the idea of the relationship?

The friends she has now are friends of the momentâ€”classmates working on the same project, neighbors in the same building, fellow minimalists exploring similar ideas. When those moments end, so too might the friendships. And that's okay.

This isn't coldness. It's honesty. Most "friends" are strangers we once knew, connected only by shared history and social obligation. Chan has eliminated the middle step: when the shared present disappears, so does the pretense.`,

      title: 'Self-Reliance',
      content: `At the core of Chan's philosophy is radical self-reliance. Not in the survivalist sense, but in the emotional sense.

"I am the deepest relationship I'll ever have," she explains. "I'm the one who knows me best, comforts me most reliably, and will be with me until death. Why wouldn't I invest primarily in that relationship?"

This came from necessity. Growing up with an emotionally volatile mother and an absent father, Chan learned early that depending on others was a recipe for disappointment. Better to cultivate your own emotional stability, your own problem-solving capacity, your own source of meaning.

This doesn't mean isolation. Chan engages with others, collaborates, connects. But she doesn't need them. She doesn't build her identity around them. She doesn't outsource her happiness to them.

When people worry about her lack of close, long-term relationships, she flips the question: "Who is more lonelyâ€”the person comfortable in solitude, or the person desperate for company?"

Self-reliance also means accepting responsibility. No blaming others for her choices. No victim mentality. If she's unhappy with her life, she changes it. If a relationship isn't working, she ends it. If a possession is burdensome, she discards it.

This level of agency is both liberating and demanding. There's no one to blame, no external savior, no comfortable passivity. Just you, your choices, and their consequences. Chan finds this infinitely preferable to dependence.`,
