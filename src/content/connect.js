Chan Meng is a Senior AI/ML Infrastructure Engineer who values genuine connection over collecting contacts. If you have something meaningful to share or discuss, here's how to reach her:

📧  Email: chanmeng.dev@gmail.com

💼  LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/chanmeng666

🐙  GitHub: github.com/ChanMeng666

A note on communication: Chan practices the same minimalism in correspondence as in life. She reads everything but responds selectively. If your message aligns with her interests or offers genuine value, you'll hear back. If not, consider the silence an answer.

She's particularly interested in discussions about:
• Minimalism as philosophy, not aesthetics
• AI/ML infrastructure and engineering
• Intentional living and decision-making
• Cross-cultural perspectives on simplicity
• Practical experiments in reduction

She's less interested in:
• Generic networking
• Product pitches or services
• Requests for her to validate your life choices
• Debates about whether her minimalism is "too extreme"

Remember: respecting someone's time is respecting their life. Make your message count.`,
