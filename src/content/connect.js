Chan values genuine connection over collecting contacts. If you have something meaningful to share or discuss, here's how to reach her:

üìß  Email: [your-email@example.com]
    (Replace with actual email)

üíª  GitHub: github.com/[username]
    (Replace with actual GitHub profile)

üíº  LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/[profile]
    (Replace with actual LinkedIn profile)

üåê  Website: [your-website.com]
    (Optional: Replace with personal website if you have one)

A note on communication: Chan practices the same minimalism in correspondence as in life. She reads everything but responds selectively. If your message aligns with her interests or offers genuine value, you'll hear back. If not, consider the silence an answer.

She's particularly interested in discussions about:
‚Ä¢ Minimalism as philosophy, not aesthetics
‚Ä¢ Intentional living and decision-making
‚Ä¢ Cross-cultural perspectives on simplicity
‚Ä¢ Practical experiments in reduction

She's less interested in:
‚Ä¢ Generic networking
‚Ä¢ Product pitches or services
‚Ä¢ Requests for her to validate your life choices
‚Ä¢ Debates about whether her minimalism is "too extreme"

Remember: respecting someone's time is respecting their life. Make your message count.`,
