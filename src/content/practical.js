      title: 'The Foam Mat Solution',
      content: `"Why do I need a bed?" Chan asked herself in 2020. "It's expensive, takes up space, and I can't move it to follow the sunlight."

Her solution: an 80 RMB (~$12 USD) foam mat. Not a mattress—a simple foam mat like you'd use for yoga or camping.

The benefits were immediate:
• Mobility: She could move her "bed" anywhere in the room
• Maintenance: No bed frame to dust, no underneath to clean
• Cost: When it wore out, replace it for $12
• Flexibility: Could serve as bed at night, seating during day

When the center of the mat sagged after six months, Chan didn't replace it. She cut the mat lengthwise, flipped the worn parts to the edges, and moved the unworn portions to the center. One mat lasted a year this way.

People worried about her back, her sleep quality, her "quality of life." But Chan slept fine. More importantly, she slept where she wanted—in the sunlight, by the window, under the moon. The foam mat was freedom.

When she moved to New Zealand's colder climate, she upgraded—to a slightly thicker foam mat and a sleeping bag. Total investment: still under $50. Still moveable. Still her choice.`,

      title: 'Social Media Purge',
      content: `In 2021, during a COVID-19 lockdown with abundant free time, Chan conducted what she calls "The Great Social Purge."

She went through every contact in her phone and WeChat. The criteria was simple: Have we meaningfully interacted in the past six months? If no, delete.

High school classmates who occasionally liked her posts? Deleted.
College friends she'd lost touch with? Deleted.
Former coworkers from previous jobs? Deleted.
That guy she went on two dates with in 2019? Deleted.

When she finished, her contact list had shrunk from several hundred to about 30 people. Later, she'd trim it further to the low 20s.

She also deleted most of her social media accounts. Weibo, gone. Douban (partially), simplified. Instagram, never had it. The only things she kept were WeChat (necessary for Chinese life) and occasionally anonymous posting on minimalism forums.

Friends who discovered they'd been deleted were sometimes hurt. "But we've known each other for years!" they'd protest. Chan's response: "Yes, and that was valuable. But it's in the past. Why maintain a connection that exists only as history?"

The relief was immediate. No more scroll anxiety. No more obligation to like, comment, maintain the appearance of friendship. No more comparing her life to others' curated highlights.

Her social media presence became what her physical presence had always aimed to be: minimal, intentional, fully present or not there at all.`,

      title: 'The Shaved Head',
      content: `Before leaving China for New Zealand in 2023, Chan walked into a hair salon and asked the stylist to shave her head completely.

The stylist, understandably worried about regret and potential blame, asked her to confirm three times. Chan confirmed three times. The stylist complied.

Walking out with a freshly shaved head, Chan felt the evening breeze on her scalp directly for the first time. It was, she recalls, "爽" (shuǎng)—a Chinese word meaning refreshingly pleasant, invigorating, satisfying.

The practical benefits were obvious:
• No more shampoo (she already used the same soap for everything)
• No more hair dryer or towel-drying wait time
• No more haircuts or styling
• No more hair as something someone could grab in a fight

That last point wasn't paranoid—it was practical. Chan had read enough about women's vulnerability to know that long hair is a liability. In any physical altercation, it's an easy target. A shaved head eliminated that weakness.

But the deeper benefit was symbolic. Hair, especially for women, carries enormous social meaning. Length, color, style—all signal femininity, attractiveness, conformity to gender norms. By shaving it all off, Chan rejected that entire system of meaning.

In New Zealand, her shaved head (which she maintains with occasional buzzing) attracts attention. Some assume she's making a statement. She is, but not the one they imagine. The statement is simply: I do what serves me, regardless of your expectations.`,

      title: 'The Fishing Vest Lifestyle',
      content: `Chan's signature item of clothing is a "fishing vest"—those multi-pocketed vests designed for anglers but perfect for urban minimalists.

Why? Because pockets are portable storage. With enough good pockets, you don't need a bag.

A typical city walk kit for Chan:
• Phone (front left pocket)
• Keys (front right pocket)
• Small umbrella (back pocket)
• Water bottle (side pocket)
• Emergency cash (inner pocket)
• Earbuds (tiny pocket)

Everything accessible, everything weightless, everything right on her body. No bag to carry, no bag to worry about, no bag to leave behind somewhere.

She combines this with practical clothing choices:
• Polyester or synthetic fabrics (quick-dry, low maintenance)
• Dark colors (hide stains)
• Same outfit combinations (no decision fatigue)
• One outer layer for cold, one for warm

People recognize her by her fishing vest. Some think it's odd. Chan doesn't care—it works. And working is the only aesthetic that matters to her.

This extends to her "city walk" philosophy. She treats the entire city as her living room. The park is her backyard. The library is her study. The cafe is her kitchen. The mall bathroom is her... bathroom. Why pay for square footage when the city already provides it?

With a fishing vest full of pockets, she can spend an entire day out, moving freely, needing nothing she doesn't carry on her body. It's mobility. It's independence. It's minimalism in action.`,
